## About
Most businesses track consumers for user engagement and marketing purposes, yet donâ€™t explicitly state so. While some forms of consumer tracking such as surveillance cameras and tracking cookies are widely known, many of us are unaware that companies use additional, obscure technologies and third party apps to track consumers in private and public spaces without their knowledge or full consent. This raises privacy concerns, since little is known about the extent of this data collection, such as the technologies utilized and the use of the data. 

This project focuses on investigating consumer tracking in public spaces through the use of one such covert technology - Bluetooth Beacons, that is now widely employed by location tracking companies, but remains largely unknown and undetectable to the general public. By gaining a firm understanding of the technology and using Android based apps for beacon detection, we aim to build a beacon location database for two retail-centric boroughs in New York City- Manhattan and Brooklyn; in order to draw insights on the participating companies and the third party vendors involved. With this work we intend to raise awareness regarding consumer tracking to eventually inform and push for reforms in data-sharing regulations and data privacy laws that ensure transparency, and ensure a legitimate purpose for the data collection processes.
